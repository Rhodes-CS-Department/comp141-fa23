    "\n",
    "Whenever we evaluate an expression, we get a *value* and an associated *type*. A **type** describes a collection of possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two examples of types are `int` and `float`:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `int` type describes *any* integer (e.g., -100, 0, 27, or 24601).\n",
    "\n",
    "(Unlike most other languages, there is no limit to how large the integer may be.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `float` type describes a real number (e.g., 0.33, 2.718281828, -5, or $10^{-100}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "There *are* limits on how large a float may be; it depends on your system, but usually a float may be between $2.3 \\cdot 20^{-308}$ and $1.7 \\cdot 10^{308}$, with up to 15 decimal places of precision.\n",

    "- A **literal** is how we directly express a value in code. For example, `3` is an `int` literal.\n",
    "- An **operator** is a symbol that accepts arguments (called **operands**) on one or both sides. For example, `*` and `**` are operators.\n",
    "- An **expression** is any well-formed Python code consisting of literals and operators (and other constructs we haven't learned yet).\n",
    "- A **subexpression** is an expression contained within an expression. For example, `2 + -3` is a subexpression of `- 1 - (2 + -3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `int` and `float` literals.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`x * y`\n",
    "\n",
    "If `x` is an `int` and `y` is an `int`, then `*` performs *exact* multiplication of `x` and `y`, giving another `int`.\n",
