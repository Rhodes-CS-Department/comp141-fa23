    "As a reminder, projects are designed to be completed individually. You may discuss the project with others, and you may help one another complete the project, but all help should follow the principle of **\"understanding, not answers.\"** In particular, you may not copy code from any source. (See the collaboration rules in the \"Programming projects\" section of the syllabus.)\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will design a [perpetual calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_calendar), which allows a user to look up the day of the week for a given date in the future or past. A major goal of this project is to introduce you to the concept of designing a large program using functions. Each function you will write has a specific task, and these functions work together to make a complete program. In this project, the steps below in the notebook will walk you through the process of designing your program. (In later projects, you will choose which functions to write on your own.)\n",
