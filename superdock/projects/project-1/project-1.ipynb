    "\n",
    "Just over 50 years ago, on July 21, 1969, the first person in human history set\n",
    "food on a planetary body other than our own. The Apollo 11 mission carried three\n",
    "humans 238,856 miles from Earth, and, while Michael Collins orbited above, Neil\n",
    "Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed upon and walked on the Moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly everything that went into achieving this feat required novel,\n",
    "groundbreaking work. For instance, all Apollo missions were almost entirely flown\n",
    "by autopilot: the [Apollo Guidance\n",
    "Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer). The AGC had a\n",
    "2.048 MHz processor, 4096 bytes of RAM, and ~72 KB of storage--the numbers are\n",
    "unimportant. Your phone is thousands of times more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lead engineer responsible for developing \n",
    "the flight control systems that flew the Apollo spacecraft was [Dr. Margaret\n",
    "Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)),\n",
    "one of the most important computer scientists in the history of our field.\n",
    "The picture below is her standing next to the listings of her code that ran the AGC.\n",

    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apollo program was one of humankinds most impressive technical achivements.\n",
    "But, beyond this, it also provided us with an opportunity for humility--an opportunity to see,\n",
    "from a distance, how very, very small our planet is--the place where every single\n",
    "human being lived and called home.\n",

    "smallness of the Earth. Instead, we will examine\n",
    "an experiment that was conducted during the Apollo 15 mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Apollo 15 physics experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In the late 1500's, the Italian mathematician Galileo Galilei demonstrated that\n",
    "acceleration due to gravity was independent of an object's mass...by\n",
    "repeatedly [dropping metal balls from the Leaning Tower of\n",
    "Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_experiment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing Galileo's Law of Free Fall breaks down somewhat when the objects aren't\n",
    "metal spheres. If you drop a hammer and a feather at the same time, they'll\n",
    "arrive at the ground at different times due to air resistence--the feather will\n",
    "float on the air, whereas the hammer will fall straight through it. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the moon, though, there is very little atmosphere to provide resistence...\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, on the Apollo 15 mission in 1971, astronaut David Scott dropped a\n",
    "feather and a hammer. The results are recorded below."
