    "A forward-thinking restaurant owner has decided to replace their usual menu with an \"interactive menu,\" and they've hired you to write the code. Your task is to write a program that asks the user a few questions about what kind of food they want, and then chooses a dish for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The restaurant owner has given you the following instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The program should print a welcome message. (e.g., \"Welcome to our restaurant!\")\n",
    "- The program should ask the user whether they want an entree or a dessert, and whether they want something hot or cold.\n",
    "- The program should ask the user for a tip percentage, and apply it to the price of the dish.\n",
    "  - If the user tips at least 20%, the program should print a message thanking the user.\n",
    "- The program should print the chosen dish, price, tax, tip, and total.\n",
    "- The program should print a closing message. (e.g., \"Enjoy!\")\n",
    "\n",
