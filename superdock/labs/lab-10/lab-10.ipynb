    "In the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, players alternate placing Xs and Os on a board until one player gets three of their symbol in a row, column, or diagonal. We will store the Tic-Tac-Toe board as a 2-d list `board` of integers, where we use the following representation:\n",
    "- If `board[i][j]` is 0, it means that the space at row `i`, column `j` is **empty**.\n",
    "- If `board[i][j]` is 1, it means that the space at row `i`, column `j` is **filled with X**.\n",
    "- If `board[i][j]` is -1, it means that the space at row `i`, column `j` is **filled with O**.\n",

    "## Suggested steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write the `print_board()` function, which should print a Tic-Tac-Toe board. For example, the output might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "X | - | O\n",
    "----------\n",
    "X | O | -\n",
    "----------\n",
    "- | - | -\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you might choose to use Unicode [box-drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character), in which case your output might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "X │ - │ O\n",
    "──┼───┼───\n",
    "X │ O │ -\n",
    "──┼───┼───\n",
    "- │ - │ -\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fill\tin the part\tof\t`main()` that places a\tpiece on the board and the part that switches the player. Look for the comments in the loop to guide you for this part. For now, don't worry about checking that the user's move is valid. You should be able to play the game now, though it will never end!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fill in the `add_row`,\t`add_column`,\t`add_diagonal`,\tand\t`add_diagonal2`\tfunctions.\n",
    "4. Fill in the `x_wins` and `o_wins` functions.\n",
    "5. Fill in the `board_full` function.\n",
    "6. Now you should be able to write a test for the loop that will stop the loop when\tsomeone\thas\twon, or if the board is full.\n",
    "7. Fill\tin the last part of\tthe\tprogram, which prints the winner or if it was a tie.\n",
    "8. Play the\tgame! Test lots\tof different situations. Fix bugs."
